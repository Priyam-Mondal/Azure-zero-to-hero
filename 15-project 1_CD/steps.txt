1. adding new images to azure container, but gitops dosnt know that new image has been pushed. so adding a new stage after build-push-update.
2. In this update stage, when ever new image is stored in acr, the image name will be changed at runtime in k8s-specifications files which has already been provided by docker team for this voting app project.
3. gitops is watching the azure git repo, so when thers a change in k8s-specification, it will deploy the new image in kubernetes cluster.
4. create azure kubernetes service
5. modify agent pool to limit resource usage for learning
6. login to k8s cluster
7. configure argocd
8. write update shell script
9. use ImagePullSecrets so that kubernetes can pull image from azure container registry because acr is private.
